# hangmangame

Hangman is originally a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or words within a certain number of guesses.

This Python version got the same concept. The player will have 6 tries to guess the word.

I got the list of words from this website: https://gogo-bimbo.skyrock.com/2897008293-Tous-les-mots-du-kemo-Ma-bimbo.html
